## **UX**
 
The website is designed for the public, gender type between ages between 25 To 65 Years of age.
The purpose of the site is to enable the users to navigate the pages in order for them to be able to see photos of our past shows,concerts and also it will enable them to take advantages of our shows offers and book tickets.
The gallery pages provide an insight into the feel of some of the shows performed in the past.
I have provided on the top level contents navigation menu for ease of use for endusers. 
There is a footer section for Social media links which gives our audience more information about the band .

I drew an initial wireframe at the inception of this project but it was not the final version it was a sketch, pleasee see PDF file.
